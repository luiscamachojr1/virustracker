All schools that should have started a new semester on March 2 are now postponed until March 22.The government will compensate business owners a maximum of about $5,000 for every employee per year according to the number of flexible work hours per week. In the event that an employee’s close relative falls ill, has an accident, or struggles due to old age, or that child care difficulties arise, he or she can take up to 10 days of unpaid leave from work.</p>

Lying about where you've been can result in 6 months of jail or a fine of up to $10,000.Anyone who catches COVID-19 in Singapore can expect to answer a lot of questions about where they've been, and who they've met along the way.If they don't comply, people can be put in jail for months or subject to thousands of dollars in fines. That is how seriously the southeast Asian city-state of 6 million takes its disease contact tracing."Contact tracing teams have been working round the clock" for more than 13 hours a day, tracing back the steps of anyone who's contracted the novel coronavirus, a Singapore Ministry of Health spokesperson told Business Insider. In what appears to be a first, disease trackers in Singapore have used an experimental antibody test for COVID-19 to confirm that a suspected patient was infected with the coronavirus. The patient was one of two people who together formed a missing link between two clusters of cases that each occurred in a Singaporean church.</p>

                                    <p>TTaiwanese health officials saw the virus taking shape in the central Chinese Wuhan in December and began checking passengers who flew in from there. They also cut off flights from much of China, the outbreak origin, before a lot of peers around Asia did.
                                    Now almost every public building in Taipei offers hand sanitizer and a lot of them, such as schools, require that anyone entering submit to a fever check. Taiwan's Centers for Disease Control announces any new cases every day. In February it began rationing facemask purchases to head off panic buying.Officials in Taiwan took a “more proactive” approach compared to other parts of Asia by stopping flights from China, lawmaker Lo Chih-cheng said. Hundreds of thousands of Taiwanese live in China and a lot of them return in the first two months of each year for holidays, a pattern that increased Taiwan’s exposure to the disease.</p>

Vietnam's Deputy Prime Minister Vũ Đức Đam stated that the Government Office, Army forces and Minister of Health have worked out various plans in case the number of affected cases burst out.Thanks to this nation-wide effort, the country has won the first fights against COVID-19 with 16 confirmed cases, 16 recoveries, and 0 death.Vietnamese response has gathered praises from several figures, comparing it to the fast Vietnamese response back in 2003 when the SARS outbreak occurred when Vietnam became the first country to be cleared of SARS. United States Ambassador to Vietnam, Daniel Kritenbrink, had praised Vietnam for its fast measures against the outbreak.U.S. delegation also praised Vietnam for its quarantine efforts, and have cooperated with the Vietnamese Embassy in the United States.</p>
